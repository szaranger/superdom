###Manipulation

####Copying

#####.clone()

The `.clone()` method performs a deep copy of the set of matched elements, meaning that it copies the matched elements as well as all of their descendant elements and text nodes.

####Events

#####.click()

Bind an event handler to the `click` JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element.

#####.dblclick()

Bind an event handler to the `dblclick` JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element.

####Removal

#####.unwrap()

Remove the parents of the set of matched elements from the DOM, leaving the matched elements in their place.

####Replacement

Replace each target element with the set of matched elements.
